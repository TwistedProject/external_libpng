Changes since the last public release (1.6.21):

Version 1.6.22beta01 [January 23, 2016]
  Changed PNG_USE_MKSTEMP to __COVERITY__ to select alternate
    "tmpfile()" implementation in contrib/libtests/pngstest.c
  Fixed NO_STDIO build of pngunknown.c to skip calling png_init_io()
    if there is no stdio.h support.
  Added an API and a number of assist macros to allow an application
    that uses the simplified API write to bypass stdio and write
    directly to memory.
  Added some warnings (png.h) and some check code to detect *possible*
    overflow in the ROW_STRIDE and simplified image SIZE macros.  This
    disallows image width/height/format that *might* overflow.  This is
    a quiet API change that limits in-memory image size (uncompressed) to
    less than 4GByte and image row size (stride) to less than 2GByte.
  Revised workaround for false-positive Coverity issue in pngvalid.c.
