Enabling SSE support

Written by Mike Klein and Matt Sarett

To enable SSE support in libpng, apply intel_sse.patch in your build
directory, before running "configure".  If you prefer,  manually edit
configure.ac and Makefile.am, following the instructions below, then
then follow the instructions in section II of INSTALL in the main libpng
directory.

Then configure libpng with -DPNG_INTEL_SSE in CPPFLAGS.  If you only
want to optimize reading 4bpp images, also use -DPNG_NO_INTEL_SSE_3BPP.

If you have moved intel_init.c and filter_sse2_intrinsics.c to a different
directory, be sure to update the '#include "../../pngpriv.h"' line in both
files if necessary to point to the correct relative location of pngpriv.h
with respect to the new location of those files.

If you are using a custom makefile instead of a configure-generated
makefile, you will have to update it manually to include contrib/intel/*.c
and to define PNG_INTEL_SSE and possibly PNG_NO_INTEL_SSE_3BPP.

1. Insert the following lines above the copyright line near the top of
configure.ac:

2. Add the following code to configure.ac under HOST SPECIFIC OPTIONS
directly beneath the section for ARM:
